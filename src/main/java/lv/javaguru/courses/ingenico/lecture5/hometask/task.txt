Task :

By default you cannot change Runnable in Thread after creation.
But it is possible to implement this logic by extending Thread class

Write class ReusableThread which extends Thread and has method
public void setRunnable(Runnable runnable)
to set and execute new Runnable

1. If setRunnable invoked during current runnable execution then IllegalStateException must be thrown
2. If additional methods needed to check state before setting new runnable then create them
3. If thread finished current runnable execution it must be switched into state WAIT
    so use wait -> notify concept to wake up ReusableThread to execute new runnable


If this task to simple for you
Write FixedThreadPool with
Queue<Runnable> taskQueue
and
ReusableThread[] treads - (array of treads, size must be setted via FixedThreadPool constructor)
When any of ReusableThread finished execution then pool executes runnable
from taskQueue in that thread.
